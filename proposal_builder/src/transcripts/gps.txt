Start of Call

Rohit: Thanks everyone for joining. I thought it would be better if we sit down and really go through the details of what we are trying to build. Our operations are getting too complex to manage on spreadsheets and calls.

Arjun: Absolutely, Rohit. Maybe you can start by walking us through a day in your operations. That usually helps us understand the flow and identify gaps.

Meera: I can explain that. Each morning, our dispatchers get the list of consignments. They then manually call drivers to assign jobs. Drivers often show up late or get confused about which consignments to prioritize. Throughout the day, our team receives dozens of calls from customers asking for ETAs. We have no systematic way to give them updates. At the end of the day, the delivery status is written down in Excel sheets, and that has to be reconciled with billing, which takes weeks.

Priya: How many dispatchers are handling this process right now?

Meera: We have eight dispatchers across different regions. They manage around 180 drivers in total.

Karan: And these drivers, are they employees or contractors?

Rohit: Mostly employees, some contractors. But for the system, we need a way to onboard both types.

Arjun: Understood. So in essence, there are three big challenges: job assignment, real-time visibility, and closing the loop with billing and proof-of-delivery.

Rohit: Correct, but I would also add route optimization. We spend a lot of money on fuel. Drivers often take longer routes simply because they know them well.

Karan: So route optimization with map integration should be a core feature. Would you want dynamic re-routing in case of traffic or delays?

Meera: Yes, absolutely. If a road is blocked or a vehicle breaks down, we should be able to reassign deliveries quickly.

Priya: Do customers currently receive any digital communication when their order is dispatched?

Meera: Right now, only some of our premium clients get a WhatsApp message from our staff manually. Most customers only get a phone call.

Arjun: Then automated SMS or WhatsApp updates after each delivery stage could save a lot of manual work.

Rohit: Exactly. Customers want transparency. Even a simple "your package is on the way" reduces phone calls.

Karan: From a technology point of view, this means we need an admin dashboard, a driver mobile app, customer notifications, billing and reporting, plus integration with your ERP.

Meera: Speaking of ERP, we are using SAP Business One. Our stock movements depend on delivery confirmation. If the new system does not update SAP, our warehouse data is off.

Priya: Noted. We will need to connect the delivery events back into SAP. Are there any other systems we should know about?

Rohit: For accounting, everything also runs through SAP. We don’t use any separate finance tool.

Arjun: Alright. Let’s discuss the driver app in more detail. What functions do you want drivers to perform?

Meera: They should see assigned jobs, the optimized route, and have the ability to mark status like "picked up", "in transit", "delivered". They should also be able to upload proof-of-delivery, either a photo or a customer signature.

Priya: Should drivers have the option to chat or call dispatchers directly from the app?

Rohit: That would be useful. Many times, drivers need help if they cannot find an address.

Karan: And language support?

Meera: At least English and Hindi. If you can add regional languages later, that’s a plus.

Arjun: What about devices? Do drivers already have smartphones?

Rohit: Yes, all of them have Android phones. We don’t need iOS.

Priya: On the admin side, what kind of access levels do you need?

Meera: Dispatchers should only see assignments and live tracking. Supervisors should be able to see analytics and reports. Senior management like Rohit should have dashboards with KPIs.

Karan: For analytics, which KPIs are critical?

Rohit: On-time delivery percentage, delays, average delivery time, fuel usage, driver productivity, and regional performance comparisons.

Priya: Would you need export features, like Excel or PDF?

Meera: Yes. We often need to share reports with partners.

Arjun: Okay. Let’s touch on compliance. Do you require digital signatures that are legally valid, or just internal confirmation?

Rohit: Both. Some of our clients, especially multinational ones, require proper signed proof of delivery. For others, a photo is enough.

Karan: That can be built. Another question: would you like geofencing? For example, to mark when a vehicle enters or leaves a delivery area.

Meera: That would be helpful. Sometimes drivers claim they reached but actually they haven’t.

Priya: Good point. Now, about customer updates. Do you want them configurable so you can change the wording, or fixed templates?

Meera: Configurable templates. We have different styles of communication for corporate clients and retail customers.

Rohit: Also, branding is important. The app and dashboard must look like ours, not like a third-party tool.

Karan: That is feasible. We can design it with your company’s logo, colors, and theme.

Arjun: Let’s talk about infrastructure. Do you prefer cloud hosting or on-premises?

Rohit: Cloud. We don’t have the resources to manage servers.

Karan: In that case, AWS would be a good fit for scalability. We can also set up auto-scaling during peak loads.

Priya: Do you have any data residency requirements? Some clients require data to remain in India.

Meera: Yes, data should stay within India.

Arjun: Noted. We will select AWS Mumbai region for that.

Karan: Regarding security, we will enforce HTTPS for all APIs, role-based access, and encryption for stored data. We can also add audit logs to track who accessed what.

Rohit: Good. One more thing: training. Our drivers are not very tech-savvy. How do we ensure adoption?

Priya: We can conduct training workshops and provide simple manuals in local languages. The app UI will also be very minimal and intuitive.

Meera: That’s important. If the app is too complicated, drivers won’t use it.

Karan: We will keep it lightweight, with offline support in case drivers lose network connectivity. Once they are online again, data will sync automatically.

Rohit: That would be ideal. Many areas still have poor network.

Arjun: For dispatchers, would you want web access only, or also a tablet app?

Meera: Web is enough. Most of them sit in the office with laptops.

Priya: And how do you handle fuel tracking now?

Rohit: We rely on driver reports and receipts. It is not very accurate.

Karan: If we capture GPS routes, we can estimate fuel consumption per trip. Later, if you integrate fuel card data, it can become even more accurate.

Meera: That’s a good idea.

Arjun: Another question, do you want multi-company support? For example, if in future you operate under different brands or subsidiaries.

Rohit: Yes, that might be useful. Some of our warehouses are operated by separate entities.

Priya: Then we can add multi-tenant support in the architecture.

Karan: Do you also need driver performance evaluation? For example, tracking delays per driver, complaints, ratings.

Meera: Yes, we have issues with certain drivers repeatedly. If the system can highlight that, it helps.

Arjun: What about notifications to drivers? Should the system also remind them about maintenance or compliance documents like insurance expiry?

Rohit: That would be a big plus. Right now we track that manually.

Karan: Alright, so maintenance reminders, document alerts, and driver scoring.

Priya: For customers, do you want a feedback mechanism after delivery?

Meera: For some deliveries yes. Even a simple rating would help us measure satisfaction.

Arjun: That can be included.

Rohit: I think we have covered a lot. Anything else from your side?

Karan: One last point. Do you want to handle payments within this system? Like collecting COD and reconciling with accounts?

Meera: Interesting. Yes, COD tracking would be helpful. Drivers often submit cash late, and reconciliation is messy.

Priya: Then we need a COD collection module. Drivers mark collected amount, system generates a receipt, and accounts team reconciles it.

Rohit: Exactly.

Arjun: Perfect. I think we now have a detailed view of requirements.
