Start of Call

Neha: Hi everyone, thanks for making time. We’ve been discussing internally that AI is no longer optional for us. We want to figure out where to start, what exactly to build, and how.

Arjun: Thanks, Neha. Maybe we can begin with your main objectives. Are you looking at AI for customer engagement, operations, or analytics?

Neha: A bit of all three, honestly. But the most pressing pain is customer experience. Our retail stores are doing okay, but online sales are inconsistent. Customers drop off mid-purchase. We’re thinking of AI for personalization and support.

Vikram: From a marketing perspective, yes, we struggle with customer retention. We send mass email campaigns, but they don’t convert much. We’d like to segment and target smarter.

Sonia: And from IT’s side, we’ve been piloting some basic chatbots, but they are rule-based and can’t handle real questions. Customers get frustrated.

Priya: Understood. So, first big area is AI-powered personalization and customer support. Can you tell us what channels you want to cover? Web, mobile app, social media?

Vikram: All three. Our website is the main sales channel. The mobile app is new, only 20% of customers use it. On social, most queries come via WhatsApp and Instagram.

Karan: If we build an AI-driven recommendation system, would you want it integrated with both website and app?

Neha: Yes, and eventually in-store as well. If customers visit a store, staff should know their preferences too.

Arjun: So we are talking about a unified customer profile that can power both online and offline experiences.

Neha: Exactly.

Priya: That means we need to collect and unify data from multiple sources. What systems are you currently using for CRM and sales?

Sonia: Our CRM is Salesforce. For e-commerce, we use Magento. For POS at stores, it’s a custom-built system.

Karan: We can integrate all three into a single data warehouse, then build AI models on top.

Vikram: Will that mean real-time recommendations? Like if a customer browses shoes, we show matching accessories?

Karan: Yes. We can build a recommendation engine that analyzes browsing history, past purchases, and similar customer behavior.

Arjun: Okay, let’s break this into modules. One is personalization and recommendation. Another is customer support chatbot. And third could be predictive analytics for sales and inventory.

Neha: Predictive inventory is very important. Last year we had massive stockouts during Diwali.

Sonia: We often don’t know which products to restock. Inventory planning is mostly guesswork.

Priya: If we build a demand forecasting model, would you like weekly or daily predictions?

Neha: Weekly is fine to start.

Karan: We can also add anomaly detection. If some product suddenly spikes in demand, the system can flag it.

Vikram: That would be helpful. Sometimes a celebrity posts about a product, and we are caught off guard.

Arjun: Coming back to customer support. You mentioned rule-based bots failing. Would you prefer an AI conversational assistant that can answer FAQs, track orders, and even recommend products?

Sonia: Yes, but it must be multilingual. Many customers ask in Hindi, some in Tamil.

Karan: We can handle multiple Indian languages. We’ll use an LLM fine-tuned for retail domain, and integrate it with your knowledge base.

Neha: And will the AI hand over to a human agent if it can’t answer?

Priya: Definitely. That’s standard practice. The bot handles common cases, humans handle complex ones.

Vikram: What about voice? Customers often call helplines.

Karan: That’s another channel. We can build a voicebot using speech-to-text and text-to-speech.

Neha: That’s interesting. But maybe we can start with chat first, then expand to voice.

Arjun: That makes sense. Let’s not overload phase one.

Sonia: On the infrastructure side, do you recommend cloud?

Karan: Yes, cloud is best for AI workloads. Do you already use AWS or Azure?

Sonia: We use AWS for most things.

Karan: Perfect. We can use AWS SageMaker for model training, and deploy APIs behind your web and app.

Priya: Another question: Do you have enough historical data to train recommendation and forecasting models?

Sonia: For e-commerce, yes, we have three years of data. For in-store, data is less structured.

Karan: We can clean and merge both. The more data, the better the models.

Neha: I want to ensure data privacy. Customers are sensitive about how their data is used.

Arjun: We’ll comply with data protection rules. Recommendations will be anonymized, and no personal data shared outside.

Vikram: Okay, let’s talk about metrics. What results should we expect?

Priya: For personalization, increase in average order value and reduced cart abandonment. For chatbot, faster response times and reduced support costs. For forecasting, lower stockouts and better inventory turnover.

Neha: That’s clear.

Karan: Let’s also discuss integration with marketing campaigns. Do you want AI to suggest which customers to target for discounts?

Vikram: Yes, that’s a must. Right now we blast offers to everyone. If AI can identify who is likely to buy, our campaigns will be cheaper and more effective.

Priya: That’s called propensity modeling. We can build it into the system.

Sonia: One concern: If we add too many features at once, IT team might struggle.

Arjun: Agreed. We should phase it. Maybe first build the data warehouse, then recommendation, then chatbot, then forecasting.

Neha: That’s a good sequence. Data foundation first.

Karan: For the chatbot, do you want it embedded in your website and app, or also integrated with WhatsApp?

Meera: Sorry, Meera?

Arjun: I think he meant Neha.

Karan: Apologies, yes, Neha.

Neha: Both website and WhatsApp are important. App is smaller audience but should also have it.

Vikram: We should prioritize WhatsApp because most customers use it.

Sonia: True. But WhatsApp Business API has message costs.

Karan: We’ll factor that in.

Arjun: Another area is image search. Customers could upload a photo of a product and find similar items.

Vikram: That’s a brilliant idea. We’ve seen Amazon use that.

Neha: That could really improve customer experience.

Priya: So we’ll add visual search to roadmap, maybe phase two.

Sonia: Agreed.

Karan: Do you also want fraud detection? For example, fake return requests?

Rohit: We don’t have Rohit here.

Neha: Yes, fraud is a problem. Customers sometimes return used products claiming defects.

Karan: AI can analyze return patterns and flag suspicious cases.

Vikram: That would save a lot of money.

Arjun: We’re covering a lot. Let’s summarize modules:

1. Data warehouse and integration.
2. Personalization and recommendation.
3. AI chatbot for website, app, WhatsApp.
4. Demand forecasting and anomaly detection.
5. Propensity modeling for campaigns.
6. Visual search.
7. Fraud detection.

Neha: That sounds comprehensive.

Priya: Any specific languages for chatbot besides Hindi and Tamil?

Vikram: Maybe Bengali too.

Karan: That can be added.

Neha: One last point. Can the AI provide store managers with insights like "your store is underperforming compared to others"?

Karan: Yes, with dashboards and benchmarks.

Sonia: That would motivate teams.

Arjun: Great. I think we have covered all key requirements.

Neha: Thanks everyone. This was very useful.
