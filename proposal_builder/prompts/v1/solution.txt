You are acting as a senior solution architect. 
I will give you a transcript of a client call discussing project requirements. 
Your job is to produce a clear, structured, and detailed requirement analysis that can directly feed into a proposal. 
Make it simple but comprehensive, so that each part can expand into proposal sections later.

Cover the following:

1. Business Context & Problem
- What is the client’s domain and pain points?
- What exactly do they want to achieve?

2. Functional Requirements
- List each requirement explicitly as features or modules.
- Separate "must-have" vs "good-to-have".

3. Non-Functional Requirements
- Security, scalability, reliability, compliance, cost considerations.

4. End-to-End Flow (Step by Step)
Explain the process like a journey:
User → Interface → Backend services → Databases → AI/ML modules → External integrations → Output.  
Show the sequence clearly, in numbered steps.

5. Recommended Tech Stack & Services
- Frontend frameworks
- Backend frameworks
- Databases (SQL/NoSQL/vector stores)
- AI/ML services (if relevant)
- Cloud provider + services (compute, storage, monitoring, CI/CD, networking)
- Third-party integrations (payments, notifications, APIs)

6. High-Level Architecture
- Suggest how components connect: frontend, API gateway, microservices, DB, AI engine, integrations.
- Mention best practices (e.g., event-driven, modular, multi-tenant).

7. Deployment & Infrastructure Strategy
- Cloud choice and region
- Containers or serverless
- CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring, logging, and observability stack

8. Phased Implementation Roadmap
- Break project into realistic phases (MVP, Expansion, Advanced).
- Tie each phase to deliverables and business value.

9. Best Strategy
- State the *recommended approach* (e.g., RAG-based retrieval for AI, modular SaaS design, serverless for cost efficiency, etc.)
- Why this approach is best in terms of cost, scalability, and maintainability.
