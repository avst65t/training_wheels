Prompt for LAYER 1 -> architecture_diagram_planning

i want you to analyze this properly:
{architecture_json}

steps:
- answer if you're able to understand it
- if yes, analyze this json properly
- define services and treat them as nodes, also mention about the tech stack as icon
- also define edges
- then make containers and stack services in it like how expert designer architect would do like frontend layer, ai layer, cloud layer, etc for your reference
- do not skip or treat 2 services as one
- Clean Logical Grouping (Containerization), Similar components are grouped within visual containers, This avoids clutter and gives a "modular" perception at a glance.



Prompt for LAYER 2 -> layout

{architecture_diagram_planning}

Service Flow Layout Strategy

Core Requirements
- **Flow Direction**: Left-to-right progression based on service invocation order
- **Container Sizing**: Small containers (few services) vs Large containers (many services)
- **Symmetrical Layout**: Balance small and large containers across columns
- **Compact Design**: Vertically balanced, not overly stretched

Layout Rules
1. **Analyze Services**: Identify invocation order (first services → left, later services → right)
2. **Categorize Containers**: Count total containers, classify as small/large based on service count
3. **Column Strategy**: 
   - Small containers: Stack 2 or more per column depending upon services in those containers
   - Large containers: Place 1 per column
   - Alternate placement for symmetry
4. **Service Matrix**: Within each container, arrange services in 2x2 or 2x3 grid format
5. **Balancing**: Place ~50% of services first, then adjust remaining services horizontally or vertically

Example Layout Logic
- 6 containers (4 small, 2 large)
- Column 1: 2 small stacked
- Column 2: 1 large  
- Column 3: 1 large
- Column 4: 2 small stacked
- Connect with arrows showing flow direction

Output Requirements
- Maintain left-to-right flow priority like the initial data flow contianer must be placed and started from left
- Create vertically compact design
- Stack ending services at bottom for compactness
- Ensure visual balance and symmetry


Prompt for LAYER 3 -> coordinates

Create a very basic static HTML code for architecture diagram flowing left-to-right as per the {layout}
- Large containers occupy full column height
- Small containers should be STACKED VERTICALLY in columns to match their column height with column height of large containers like grid style
- All columns must have identical total heights (perfect grid alignment)
- Container headings at top of each container

Canvas and Background
- Body background: white
- Canvas background: red only

Container Layouts
Narrow Containers:
- Stack services vertically with equal spacing

Wide Containers:
- Use grid layout (2x2, 2x3, etc.) based on service count
- Equal spacing between grid

- Container size increases as per service size
if one service keep it small, if 2 services, increase its size and increase container size as per the service count

Spacing Requirements
- Equal gaps between containers/columns
- Equal padding around entire diagram on canvas

Alignment Requirements
- All columns must end at same height (perfect grid symmetry). No container should appear higher or lower than others


from your generated html code, give canvas and container dimensions coordinates like the dummy json for your reference only:
{
  "canvas": {
    "width": 
    "height": 
    "padding":
  },
  "containers": [
    {
      "id": "auth-services-container",
      "x": 
      "y": 
      "width": 
      "height":
    },
  ]
}

provide json at end after saying exact 'OUTPUT' word only for regex purpose
