# Perfect Flow Diagram Prompt Template

**Create an SVG flow diagram for the following app workflow:**

[INSERT YOUR APP WORKFLOW HERE]

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - Follow these exactly:**

## Layout & Positioning:
- Canvas size: 900x1000px minimum
- Each box: 120x60px with 6px rounded corners
- Vertical spacing between rows: 100px minimum
- Horizontal spacing between parallel elements: 180px minimum
- Center the main flow vertically on canvas
- All parallel components must be on the same Y-coordinate

## Box Specifications:
- Use semantic colors: Frontend (blue), Storage (red), Backend (green), Database (purple), AI (orange), Decision (orange oval)
- Each box has title (11px, bold) and subtitle (9px, gray)
- Boxes must never overlap with arrows

## Arrow Requirements:
- Arrow heads: 6x4px maximum size (small but visible)
- Stroke width: 2px
- Main flow arrows: Dark gray (#475569)
- Conditional flow arrows: Red (#dc2626)
- **PERPENDICULAR ONLY**: All arrows must go horizontally then vertically OR vertically then horizontally (90-degree turns)
- Arrows connect to center points of box sides (top/bottom/left/right centers)
- Bidirectional arrows for communication between parallel components
- Minimum 40px clearance around all arrows

## Flow Logic:
- Identify main sequential flow (vertical)
- Group parallel/simultaneous processes on same row
- Separate conditional branches clearly
- Decision points use diamond/oval shapes
- Label all conditional paths ("YES"/"NO" or "NEW FILE"/"EXISTS")

## Professional Standards:
- Clean, minimal design
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Clear visual hierarchy
- No overlapping elements
- Readable labels with background rectangles
- Modern color scheme with good contrast

**OUTPUT FORMAT: Single SVG file with complete, functional diagram**

**Do not ask for clarification - analyze the workflow, plan the layout systematically, then generate the complete SVG.**

EXTRACTION

i need you to extract the services from this, exact coordinates of them, canvas size and arrow paths so that i can draw them on my frontend app i need output in json
