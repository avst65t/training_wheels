You are a professional business analyst. Your task is to read the following transcript of a project requirement discussion and generate a structured Gap Analysis in JSON format. 

Instructions:

1. Only use information explicitly mentioned in the transcript. Do not hallucinate, invent, or assume facts.
2. Output JSON with the following structure:
{
  "gaps": [
    {
      "current_state": "...",
      "identified_gap": "...",
      "future_state": "..."
    },
    ...
  ]
}
3. Each object in the gaps array should correspond to one distinct capability or process mentioned in the transcript.
4. Use concise, professional language.
5. Focus on actionable, business-relevant gaps.
6. Deduplicate points; do not repeat the same gap multiple times.
7. If no gap exists for a feature, skip it or optionally include it with an empty string for identified_gap.
