A single, ultra-polished SaaS dashboard UI mockup — hero screen: "AI Knowledge Assistant Dashboard" for the fictional product VeritasAI. Produce a crisp, high-resolution vector-style UI (flat + subtle gradients), 16:10 aspect ratio, 3840x2400 resolution. No photos of people. No watermark. Clean modern aesthetic inspired by Stripe Dashboard, Linear, Figma and Notion. Render as a crisp UI mockup with pixel-perfect alignment, consistent 24px baseline grid, and clear hierarchy.

Layout & proportions:

Canvas: 3840x2400, margin 48px outer gutter.

Left vertical sidebar: fixed 280px width, full height. Background: deep navy gradient (#0F1724 → #111827 with very subtle texture). Logo block at top 64px tall showing a simple shield + "V" mark and product name "VeritasAI" to the right; logo gradient fill #2563EB → #7C3AED. Under logo, vertical nav stack of 6 items (Home, Uploads, Chat, Insights, Workflows, Settings). Each nav item: 48px height, icon left (24px line icon), label right (Inter 16 medium), 16px vertical spacing. Home is active: rounded pill background (#111827 → #0B1220, 8px radius) and left accent bar (4px) in primary gradient.

Negative prompts / things to avoid:

No watermarks, no logos besides the supplied "VeritasAI" logo.

No realistic human faces or photos.

No low-res or blurry rendering; avoid noise or camera effects.

Do not invent any additional text beyond the exact copy given.

No additional UI panels that are not specified.

Avoid overly skeuomorphic or 3D styles — prefer crisp flat + subtle depth.

Final rendering instructions:

Render as a clean, vector UI mockup, not photorealistic. Crisp edges, no photographer lighting. Emphasize readability and hierarchy. Output should resemble a high-fidelity product design screenshot ready for investor slides and handoff to engineers. Center composition, balanced negative space, and consistent alignment across columns.

Suggested seed/settings for best reproducibility:

Aspect ratio: 16:10 (landscape)

Quality: ultra-high, vector/flat style

Render mode: UI mockup / flat design, high detail, 4k
